# OmniSolve AI System

OmniSolve is a local, role-based AI software orchestration system designed to plan, generate, validate, and 
incrementally extend software projects using a disciplined, multi-agent workflow.

The system simulates a structured software development team by coordinating specialized AI agents such as 
Architect, Planner, Developer, and QA each operating under strict responsibilities and handoff contracts. This 
approach prioritizes determinism, traceability, and safe continuation over one-shot code generation.

OmniSolve is intended for solo developers who want a persistent, local-first AI development environment that 
emphasizes architectural correctness, incremental evolution, and professional software engineering practices.
